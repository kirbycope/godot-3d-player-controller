# godot-3d-player-controller
A 3D Player Controller for the Godot Game Engine.

## Getting Started
Include this addon with your project. No need to "activate" as the inteded usage is to copy the controller files to the `/addons` folder and for you to then copy it to your scene/script folder and modify as need. This way if/when you pull down the latest, it will not overwrite your changes.

### Installing the Addon
1. Download [install-3d-player-controller.sh](ci/install-3d-player-controller.sh)

1. Run `bash ci/install-3d-player-controller.sh`

[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) allows you to host web pages, locally, from VSCode.

### Generate HTTPS Certificate
"Secure Context - Check web server configuration (use HTTPS)" The following features required to run Godot projects on the Web. Do the following to setup
